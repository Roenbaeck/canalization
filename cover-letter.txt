AI-assisted tools disclosure:
In preparing this manuscript, I used AI-assisted tools (Grok 4.2, Opus 4.6, and GPT-5.2) to help with drafting and editing text and with generating LaTeX/TikZ figure code. All mathematical claims, calculations, and the final wording were reviewed and validated by me. AI tools are not listed as authors.

Sincerely,

Lars Rnnbck
